# Version 0.1.5

Currently, 0.1.5 is latest version AND the current working version.  In the future we will freeze 0.1.5 (leaving it as the latest) and create a development version.

## Differences with previous version (0.1.0)

* Inputs into a CML structure can now have subcomponents labeled (each component of an array for example can have a label)
* Operations can have multiple input/param objects
* Many more operations are detailed / have jsons describing them
* Catagories of Operations have been changed/shuffled
* More operations added (toLog, runCML, tensor2im, etc.)
